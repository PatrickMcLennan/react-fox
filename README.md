# react-fox

This was bootstrapped with my [create-treact-app](https://www.github.com/PatrickMcLennan/create-treact-app) repo. This project is also a code-along with [this awesome how-to guide](https://codeworkshop.dev/blog/2020-06-23-build-a-game-with-react-three-fiber-and-recoil/).

## What is this?

A 3d Starfox-like shooting game. Utilises react-three-fiber + recoil to handle the visuals and state management.
